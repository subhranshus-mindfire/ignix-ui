    './node_modules/@animate-ui/core/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      keyframes: {
        // ... your existing keyframes
      },
      animation: {
        // ... your existing animations
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Accordion>

        <Accordion.Trigger>What is Animate UI?</Accordion.Trigger>
        <Accordion.Content>
          Animate UI is a beautiful component library with built-in animations.
